# Nihilism

There is this story that:

Alexander, a young Macedonian, met at the bank of river Indus, what he called a "gymnosophist", which means "the naked, wise man". We don't know who he was. Perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky and the sun and the moon.

Alexander asked, "What are you doing?" and the gymnosophist answered, "I'm experiencing nothingness." Then the gymnosophist asked, "What are you doing?" and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world". And they both laughed. Each one thought that the other was a fool. The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world? It's pointless". And Alexander thought, "Why is he sitting around, doing nothing? What a waste of a life".

To understand this difference in viewpoints, we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander -- his myth, and the mythology that constructed it. They told him of a great hero called Achilles, who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured, but when he withdrew from the battle, defeat was inevitable. That's what he heard. Don't live a life which is monotonous, mediocre, meaningless. Be spectacular! -- like the Greek heroes, Because, you see, the Greeks believed you live only once

But the gymnosophist heard a very different story. He heard of a man called Bharat. Bharat also conquered the world. And then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. And he wanted to hoist his flag to say, "I was here first". But when he reached the mountain peak, he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him, each one claiming "'I was here first' ... that's what I thought until I came here". And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity, Bharat felt insignificant. This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. He had heroes, like Ram and Krishna. They were two lifetimes of the same hero. When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. When Ram dies, Krishna is born. When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram. You go to and fro endlessly. Nothing lasts forever in India, not even death. What goes around always comes around.

Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world. One linear, one cyclical. One believes this is the one and only life. The other believes this is one of many lives. And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one. So, the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. So, no matter what he did, it was always zero.

This story clarifies the difference between realism and nihilism.


## Cosmos and Quantum

Many a times, what we know and what we don't know is particularly due to scale. When we know through our observation and experience using our senses - it is limited by the scale we are able to perceive. The scale - in time, as well as in space, plays a major role in our understanding, so much so that the properties of the object seem to change with scale.

The Earth may appear flat to us, when there is actually a curved surface when we see the bigger picture. For our normal walking and living on Earth - its flatness suffices. But to travel to the moon, and to measure the shortest distances between two distant points on Earth - its curve matters. It depends upon the objective of the observer as to what scale matters.

Similar is the case of time also - a lot of the problems of our daily lives become trivial if we look at the bigger picture or focus on a larger span of time.
When we were kids, we used to cry for the lost toys - but it is of no significance to us now as that pain was short lived, compared to the pain of lost loved ones now. The intensity of the pain is same - but the duration added the weightage & significance.

There is a change in our perspective with change in scale. There is a difference in attitude when we see the grand and the miniscule.

When we see the small - like ant, there is some ease and certainty regarding its behaviour & change. When we see the grand like galaxy or a vast mountain, there is a sense of confusion and unease - as we are sure that there must be something more, outside our reach & perception. There is a role is time too. We feel it takes relatively longer time to know the grand fully, as it manifests changes over a larger period of time.

But, the recent advancement of science in quantum or sub atomic level hai revealed a lot of unnerving information which too is beyond our understanding - and we feel lost in the quantum particles, the way we are lost among galaxies. Only after going in the subatomic level, have we realised that all the matter has dual nature - particle & wave.

The grand things before us like - trees, animals, and Earth & Moon, never appeared to show the wave nature as do the quantum things.
Initially started off as the dual nature of light - which makes all observation possible, it turned out that everything - grand or small, should be showing the dual nature.

But, there are some bizzare and unexplained phenomena in the quantum world that require scientific exploration to arrive at some conclusion. Two of which are - the quantum entanglement, and the collapsing of quantum duality when some observation is made (double slit experiment). Entanglement is about the change in spin of two particles light years apart - simultaneously, where some sort of information-exchange appears, faster than the speed of light. The other one is a case of a subject/observation changing the reality/object, or in other sense - the electron either shows wave or particle nature upon not / being observed.

It appears that the observation might have collapsed the waveform into a definite trajectory. The same could be true with the grand things we see.

Most of the things that we could not do in childhood was primarily because we had smaller hands. It was not about intellect or skills. It could be just about pouring water from a large bottle or handling another big object. With larger hands come greater degree of freedom.

Same is the case with our perception. We lack certain degrees of freedom in the Cosmos and the Quantum. It is not about right or wrong.


## What is the value of anything at all?

This is an important question. It takes contemplation to arrive at this thought.
It is prevalent in the ascetic traditions of Buddhism & Zen, hedonism of Charvakas, determinism of Ajivikas, western Nihilism involving sadism, and in Vedantic principles.

The connotation or the feeling in which the question has been used might differ. Based on this difference, we see that the nihilism can have two aspects - sadistic or emancipating.

Western writers like - Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche, could have both the traits - we cann't say for sure. When we annihilate the validity of all of our experiences & pre- dispositions, we attain a state of peace and dejection. It can't get approval from the society whose existence and survival depends on the validity of such experiences and past inputs.

Nihilism is about making oneself free - from the past inputs and from the expectations of the society. Either an ascetic or a lunatic can do that.

The same question: "what is the value of anything at all?", can be posed towards the goodness of things as well as towards the moral obligations and badness of things.


Hence, in the Yogic traditions - it has been said that there is nothing good or bad. There is just this existence - an interplay of cause and consequences. It goes on to say that morality has no value. We need laws and restrictions because our minds are not in our control. Human rights, equality and justice are the creations of the desperates. The simple process of life has been made trickier by the mind and its treachery.

Hatred and affection are one and the same. They go hand in hand. Thus nihilism is so relevant.

Even when our direct experiences - like time, age, prosperity, and desires are fooling us, what then can be said of the acquired or inferential knowledge?

"Nothing we are experiencing is true, and it's all a limited knowledge" - it looks like the tone of a dejected and a loser, who is lost and in dispair. But, that sentence puts the Self in utmost importance. Maya could be there in the outside, but instead of criticizing it, let's thank her in making us realize the importance of the one observing - the Self.

Only the Self is important in the whole discourse of moving from the known to the unknown. Maya shows us the way - by surprising us with the randomness.
