# The theory of Creation


**Shiva and the dimensions**

Shiva is one of the trinity of the Gods in Hinduism and mostly considered the highest of all, and attributed to be the God of destuction. The other two being Vishnu - the protector, and Brahma - the creator. 

These personalities find hundreds of references in the Puranic texts, but they could also be representing the subtle form of the nature and the phenomena. 

One interesting aspect to note is that this trinity is assocated with their respective feminine counterparts too, who se depicted as their wives. Lakshmi - the goddess of wealth is with Vishnu, as the world requires prosperity to function well and flourish. Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge accompany Brahma. This implies the creation require the support of knowledge or information. We'll talk about the information theory later.

*Shi-va*, whose literal meaning is *"that which is nothing"*, is accompanied by Shakti (personified as Sati/Parvati). Shakti represent the all powerful, from whom the gods derive their powers. The infinite energy is the partner of Shiva.

Now, Shiva himself has various dimensions - Puranic, Yogic, Vedic and Tantrik, based on how different philosophies perceive him. He is even reverred by the Asuras of Puranas, who are against all the other gods as per the Lexts. Vishnu, who is to maintain balance - is mostly in tussle with the Asuras.


Shiva is considered the *Adiyogi* - the first yogi who transmitted the knowledge and powers of Yoga to humans. He had abode in *Kailasha*, Himalayas. It seems he was a human who marries Parvati and transcends the boundary to become Shiva. That person is the *Shankara* whose forms and descriptions are available. He is worshipped as *sakara* (with form).

The teachings about Self and Yoga happened to the Saptarishis and Goddess Parvati separately. Yoga captures the former teachings in the Patanjali Yog sutras, and The Tantra captures the latter in the Paratrishika and the Vigyan Bhairav Tantra.

The tantrik texts assign the Supreme Reality to be the Shiva only and the Goddess to be the way through which to reach the Shiva state. Even Puranic texts mention him the sole creator of the cration, or the *Nirakar* (formless) Brahm. Formless are not worshipped but considered the essence of True / Ultimate Reality. Point to be noted is that Brahma is creating a smaller creation / universe. What comes under Shiva is of bigger significance as it covers Brahma, Vishnu and every thing available. This can be understood either by the concept of multiverse, or through mathematical dimensions. The purpose of Yoga is also to witness the true self and the nothingness within. It says humans have the capability to reach the Shiva state or become Shiva.

- The infinite possibility is within the reach of humans

Our present day science talks of the space-time fabric - originating from Einstein's theory. Research is going on upto the very fundamental particle of nature and string theory is proving to be a reasonable contender. It says that the basis of existence are stringe vibrating at different frequencies. Now, to sustains such varied frequencies it demands the existence of more than three spacial dimensions that we are accustomed of. Some say 11 dimension would be enough to accomodate all the variations and complexities of the universe. Some could be of space, some of time - nothing is sure as of now.

There are ideas that assign higher spatial dimensions to Brahma and to Vishnu and then to Shiva. The higher the dimension, the more encompassing and all pervading he is. As we go up in higher dimension, the entity or volume in lower dimensions tend to be smaller and diminishing. So, it is possible that whole of the existence can be crumbled into a dot or a point. That's the concept of nothingness. At the level of shiva, no identity remains, no separation. The entity is Kevali (or alone) and non-dual - meaning that it is neither one nor two.

My contention is that there are nine spacial dimensions of our worldly manifestations and two are the time dimensions - giving rise to the cyclic time that is profound in Indian philosophies. But does that mean we can go in past and future? No. Cyclic time and existence only mean that we are forced upon such situations in cycle. 

The creation happens the cycles and is followed by desolution after the civilization goes matured enough that only unethical acts remain - propounded by the Puranas. Although puranas consist of stories and myths but these become important to glue the society together. They are considered to carry lesser weightage for an intellect compared to Vedas & Upnishads, but their exposition on time and multiverse are worth noting. We have the crationist theories in every phillsophies that try to find its place in the Universe. But Hinduism is unique to talk about the desolution and attribute it to the highest God - Shiva. The creation we are talking about here is 3-dimensional.

Shiva is the pure conciousness. The whole universe has emanated from him and will dissolve into him. The materials of the creation came about from the Spandan or the energy aspect of him. It is said that the material world came into existence to let the Shiva experience onself. As we are observing, we are the window through which our pure Self or Shiva comes to witness itself. This happens by the illumination of the conciousness over the mind and we manifest several things.

Here, it is important to also talk about Shiva-linga or the emblem of Shiva. It is symbolic structures highly reverred in Hinduism. Some call it a phallic representation, others find it outrageous to call it a phallus. There are some ancient Shivlingas that exactly resemble phallus, plus there are narratives in the Puranass depicting penis of the Shankara.

It is true that *linga* literally means the allegory - A placeholder that contains the complete essence of the subject. That's why we have *pul-linga* (masculine) & *stri-linga* (feminine). It also represents the genital of a male. 

It is ridiculous that Hindus nowadays are so influenced by the West that they cannot conceive the thought of the Phallus being a pure subject. We have theories of *Linga Pujana* and *Yoni Pujana*. Yoni means female genital, or a place of conception. There is great deal of meaning in the choice of Sanskrit words.

In the Shaiva creationist theory, linga is the first 'form' that appeared when the creation started. It was elliptical and encompassing everything. It is the complete space. There is a culture of celebrating the fertility in India. It has a unique place in all the traditional cultures across the world. There is something divine in creation. To conceive a life - it requires Godly intervention. Or maybe simply just some data and intelligence. It's all a play of words, and judgements arising due to ignorance.
