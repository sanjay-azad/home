4.5 shiva and the dimension shiva is one of the trinity of the Gods in Hinduism and mostly hod comidered the highest of all, and attributed to be the of destuction. Other two being Vishnur - brotector, and Brahma- creator. These personalities finds hundrede of references in the Pumic

fext, but they could be representing the subtle form of the

nature and the phenomena one interesting arpect to note is that this trinity is assocats with their respective feminine counterpart two who se depicted as their wives. Lakshmi - the weddess of wealth. Te with Vishnce, de the world requires prosperity to fruction well and flourish. Samewahi accompany the Goddess of knowledge Brahmas This implies the creation require to support of knowledge/ information. We'll talk about info theory later.

shi-va, I whose literal mearity is "that which is nothing". Te accompanied by Shakh" (personified or sati/farvati). Shalt represent the all powerful haddess from whom heds derive their powers. The infinite energy in the porther of Shiva.

Now Shiva himself has various dimensione Yonic, vedic and Tantrik - based on how different philosof perceive him. He is even reversed by the Asuxas of Pasange who are first all effer Gods as per the Lexts. Vishu is mostly intussle with Asus who in to maintain bulance.

The teaching about- self and Yogu happend to saptastis and Godder Parvati sparately. Yoga captures the teachings in the Patanjali Yog sutras and The Tambo Bat captures datter in the Parsbishika and the Vigyan Bhanu Panton.

The tantok text assigns the Supreme Reality to be the Shim only and the Goddess to be the way through whith to reach shiva state Evan Pasunic texts mention him the sole exentor of the cration, or the Marakar (formless) Bouhm. Formiles. are not wrschipped but considered the essence of True! ultimate Reality Point to be noted that Balma is excating a smaller creation / universe. What comes under Shiva ie of bigger significance as it covers Brahma Niehm and every thing avadable.

Our presunt by science tulke of the speice-time fabric - originating from Einstein's themy. Research be going on to the very fundamental particle of nature and string thusy 15 a reasonable contender. It says the bacy's of existence are stringe vibouting at different Brynencies. slow to sustains such vaned freivenage it demands the existence of more than3. spreid dimention that we are accustomed of. Some say 11 dimension would be enough to accomodate all vanation: an complexities of universe. Some could be of space, some of time- nothing sure as of new?

There are ideas that assign 4th spatial limention to Bankin and like this, Vishnu and then Shiva -the Lighin the more encompassing and all pervading he is. As we go in higher dimension the entity or volume in lover dimensions tend to be smaller and diminishing so. it is possible that whole of the existence can be crumbled into a dot or point. That's the conceptoff nothingness. At the level of shiva. identity remains, mos the entity in Kevali (or alone) and non-dual means if is neither one nor two. ã€‚ sepasatenes

My contention is that there are 9 space dimensions of our worldly experiences and 2 time dimension - giving rise to the explic time that is profand in Indian philosophice. But does that mean we can go in past and future? No. Cyclic time and existence only such situatione in cycle. mean that we are forced upon

The creation happens the cytes and is followed by desolution after the evilization goes matured enough that only onethind acte remain propounded by the Puranas. Although puranas consist of stories and myths but there become important to glue the society together. They are considered to carry sewer weightage to an itstellack compared to vader & Cipresto! but their exposition on time and multiverse are worth noting. are have the crationist thing in every phillsophies that buy. to find it's place in the Universe. But Hindviem is unique to talk about desolation and attribute it to the highest ged-Shiva The creation we are talking about here is 3-dimensional.

At one are observing, we are the window through which our pare self Self or shiva comes to witness strelf. This happens by the relumination of the conciousness over the mind and we manifest several things.

slave it in important to also talk about Shiva-lina or t emblem of shiva. It is symbolic structures highly serassed in Leindum. Some call it a phallic representation, others find it outrageous to call it a phallus.

It is tave that ling a literally means the allegory: A placeholder that contains the complete essence of the subject- That's why we have puting (masculine), Stilinga feminine). It also repressof the genital of a make. Tie ridiculous that Hindue newadays are so influenced

by the West that they cannot conceive the thought of the Phallus being a puxe subject. We have theries of linga Pujaren and Yoni pujana. Your means female genital of conception. There is choice or a place great deal of meaning in the # Samint words.

2h Shaiva crationist theory. lingar it the first form' appersed when the creation started. It was elliptical and encompacing everything. It is the complete space. There is a culture of celebrating fertility in Indian It has unique plance in all the traditional cultures across the world. There is something divine in creation. To conceive a life - it require Godly intervention - or maybe simply just data and intelligence. It's all a play of works and judgement arising due to ignorance.
