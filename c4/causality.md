# Causality & the origin

4.4 Causality and the Origin : For humane, causing to the question of who am I? or why am I here? Px not strightforward. We live, we by we dance and we go in despair and we dament.

We have identified ourselves with moods and we finition based on our needs and abilities. We have an image of ourselves that is coming from past dispositions and tendencies./personality.

We realise with experience that all the effects has sema cause - whether it's natural effect in our own experience Some events or actions become cause of some of the effects that might become cause of another set of eats. or that might rephire some action gent to cause

next set of effects.

This realization puts us into doing the right thing along doing is coming back as courerences. It takes time to observe such patterns. If you study, kfou see you are passing with flying coloves and that can put you in certain condition where only you have to act against as someone who falls flat- without studying. Rup-he that comme too have to alf at semne different-site- riginating out of acad whic foulure. Since we dont'

know the farture, this urge to do the right thing takes the form of looking back at all out cause decisione, individuals as well as secital. This guises the question of our existence. But more

there is a quest to know the total existence the nature and its phenomena, the cosmes and the origin as we are a part of it and our experiences are a product of it. The idea is that by back bucing the origin of everything We dould be able to know who am I and why am I? The question of what is causing what effect is vary desp complex one as there could be loses of factors deviding our that, and that is precisely the season why attempting to know the future is a vague one still we are -doing it as it has challeryes that intoxicate our imagination. Causality is a reality that is driving the wheel of coation forward by making things happen.

That's why at the start of everything , we have to supposk an existence that is uncaused cause To understand such. discussion there should always be a defined system. If the system is whole of miverse - then that primal cause has to be present inside which manifested as the unitse- If the system ie any smaller, the initial cans can be four the outside.

When we make correlation bound intelligent systems. as Al we conclude that correlation is not capterning whole of the pattern. It's the causality that depicts likelihood of events and happenings. It covere pontoms or rather randomness of the Universe. In that grandness of complexity it becomes clear that it is not about good bad. It is about existence and universe taking a on definite configuration.

we are a product of it, or rather a part of process that Pas set to produce more complex entities. The cratim is in full throttle. There is nothing bad or harmful, we are here to observe Realised being do not criticize or

An analysis of carsality from effects perspective maker ve belive that no consequences are good or bad. It's about our acceptance or refusal of the concyronce.
