# The nature of Reality

Across the Indian subcontinent, there is a great number of dieties - some from godly origin and some from human, a lot of saints and wise people who obtaind the status of great souls, few people believe in *Karma* few believe in other worldly lives, some believe in God behind the creation others don't, some believe in life after death and then there are stories of mukti/enlightenment. There are creationist principles who talk of consciousness and energy, and there are some who talk of jiva, brahman and atman. Some philosophies have a common source of Vedas, others dont have Vedas as autherity - still find similarity among the notions and beliefs. 

Still, there are some common themes like cyclic times, illusions, creation and the oneness of things, and mukti/liberation.

There are dual as well as non-dual principles in the nature of things. We'll talk about them both. 

The human body is conceived of the carrier or the temple, able to ferry us to the unknown or to bring the divinity amongst us.

Here, we shall talk of some of the refined forms of the Indian philosophy - Vedanta: dual and non-dual, Sankhya: the oldest philosophy talking of the dual character of the Reality, and Kashmir Shaivism with non-dual principle and Buddhism seeking the oneness of things.

What are dual and non-dual? 

It is the primal entity or energies that gave rise to creation in succession, What is present in everything and what is timeless. It is the essence of the God and cause of all effects. That entity is referred to as *Brahman* in Vedanta, *Paramshiva* in Shaivism, and *Buddha* in Buddhism.

In contrast, the Sankhya theory talks of two primordial realities giving rise to creation - Purusha & Prakriti.

Interesting thing is that the Vedanta has picked Purusha or consciousness as the Brahman - or the one encompassing all energies or Prakriti. Similarly, Shaivism talks of both the elements - Prakriti and Purusha originating out of Paramshiva or the pure consciousness throbbing with *spandan* or vibration. 

There has always been a quest to know the nature of the Supreme Reality. That entity has sometimes been referred to as the God - or the creator. The beautiful thing is that the creator has been a part of the creation all along. 

It's like the ocean and a drop - the ocean is all pervading and the drops has come out of it. Drop has all the properties of the ocean and is capable of being ocean itself. The Ocean is living inside the drop.

Nature of all the infinity of elements of universe is what the nature of the *God* is - pure consciousness and an aspect of energy into it. That energy manifests as matter. We can assign any name to the Reality but what's important is the charater.


**Atman and Brahman**

Everybody is aware that we are making our own reality. We know of relative goodness and badness of things. We know that our mood changes and it hampers how we are going to take the world today. No doubt, there are objective truths like taxes, tragedies and accidents, flowers, greeneries and responsibilities.

There are some aspects that we think we are going to handle on our own - with our own mind, energy and consciousness. At the same time there are some concenrs that are driven by the divine will or consciousness. So, we have given them names - Atman and Brahman. 

Brahman is a concept of pure consciousness - finds mention in Vedantic non-dual philosophy. It is important as Vedanta is supposed to be most mature and refined way of looking at life - relying on Vedic knowledge. This entity of pure consciousness pulsating with energy is described as ParamShiva in the Spanda system of Kashmir shaivism.

Atman is the inner core self of what we relate to - the one who is all observing, undisturbed by thoughts, emotions and memory/dispositions. Atman is all pure and sometimes considered part of the God or Brahman - thus attributing the main goal of Atman to be the union with the God or witnessing the God within. These are individual consciousness as against Pure.


So, consciousness is one of the property of the essence of reality, or that the Ultimate Reality is consciousness only. This is the primitive, primordial aspect that gave rise to everything - hence all the elements of creation, whether matter or energy has an aspect of intelligence. Creation theories in Tantra and Shaivism talks of the union of intelligence and energy to give rise to the whole nature.

**Purusha and Prakriti**

Here, it to important to mention the Sankhya darshan: the oldest Vedic philosophy. As a quest to know the true nature of reality, it goes up to the duality of Purusha and Prakriti.
It says there are two realities: Purusha which is only consciousness - free from matter; and Prakriti which is ever changing and flowing and giving rise to matter.

Purusha is translated as self/soul or consciousness as it is neither mind, nor brain, nor ego, nor intellect. There are many Purushas. 

Prakriti in the nature or matter aspect that is the uncaused cause underlying all worldly effects. It is the potentiality of nature, which can neither be created nor be destroyed. It only changes forms. It resembles the energy concept of thermodynamics. It is the cause of all effects, and changes in the forms. It is constituted of the three *gunas* (properties) - *Sattva*, *Rajas*, *Tamas*.


If Prakriti and Purusha remain separate, there is dissolution (*Pralay*). For evolution (srage/srishti), they must unite. The inactive Purusha and the non-intelligent Prakriti cooperate to serve the and, and this disturbs the balance of the three gunas and that leads to the evolution or creation (Sankhya Karika: 21). This notion resembles the Tantric philosophy of the union of Shiva and Shakti.

Kashmir Shaivism talks of Shiva and Shakti emerging out of the Paramshiva (pulsating consciousness) as the first and the second elements of creation, respectively.

Shiva is the passive consciousness, and the shakti is the consort of Shiva which is the pure energy element. Their union gives rise to several other elements of creation like senses, Maya and language. Although interestingly, the tantrik or shaivism text talk of Purusha and Prakriti as emerging out of the Paramshiva only - but at the later stage as 12th and 13th elements after the Maya and its agents out of the primal 36 elements it talks about (appendix).

Now, it could be a matter of choice of words or just the subjective reality how the two philosophies talk of the same elements on two different levels of the reality. One thing is certain that it is some sort of union that triggered the creation. What existed before that?
