# The Reality


The question is that - why do we want to know the Truth or the Ultimate Reality? What is harmful for us in being stuck in the transient or deceptive things without knowing the complete picture? 

We have all the pleasures here, we are enjoying and merrrying and feasting. In Sanskrit, we have a term called *bhog* to denote the objects of all sorts of pleasures. We acquire and we extract and savour our possessions. 

The humanity is a *bhogi* when we dwell in the outside world and extract all sorts of elements to feed our desires and aspire for contentment. Similar is the case of *Yogis* who discard external pleasure and move inwards for their spiritual contentment. Whenever there is a desire - either for material pleasure or for spiritual contmentment, there is change - and hence no *Reality*. Both are not satisfied. There is a process of attainment and longing.

Life is happening within them while they are questing for *accomplishments* and *achievements*. Both of these word become shallow when we see them in light that our own perception is fed by our past memories and predispositions. What we believe to be some achievement of the humanity - that is coming from our perception generated through scriptural and societal norms. When we see that there are metrics of good and bad, right and wrong, which are deciding accomplishments and those metrics too are relative across space, situation and person - a doubt on our perception arises.


The second question is that - how do we know that the external world is not real? Aren't these plants, animals, air and water, mountains who are enriching us real? When something is nourishing us, we have the responsibility to consider them real.

In the vast expanse of cosmos, we are just some tiny offshoots of nature who think who have will power. We distinguish between the living and non-living, natural & man-made. We are blessed with good intellect, and large memory. We think that the creation is for ourselves to savour our imagination. At the same time, we are aware of the grand and the miniscule to be beyond our perceptin. We perceive a very small segment of creation in space and time. That's why, creating a generalised theory about the Universe seems a tedious task.

People have done efforts to demystify through the classical physics, and then quantum and relativity. There has been an ongoing attempt to unify the forces of nature that we know about. There is string theory that talks of the presence of several more dimensions in space to make this creation possible. These all reveal a quest for knowing the reality behind the existence. This has been explored in greet lengths by the pioneers of the Indian philosophy. The reality is composed of many threads that we'll unravel in coming chapters.
