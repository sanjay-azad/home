# Fear & Insecurities

No matter how much we attempt to remove them from our lives, they always show up unwarranted. Although they are just somee emotions in our mind, they materialize and originate from our worldly affairs. Hence are very real.

We fear the loss, we fear for the reputation, we fear about our own judgements of good and bad. No matter how much the society has taught us, and no matter how much knowledg we have gathered - when it comes to applying our wisdom - we fear. 

We feel insecuree about our achievements - all the good relationships we have accumulated, our wealth, and our states of pleasure/hapiness.

The fear originates because of the unpredictability. We don't know the real consequences of our actions. We don't know the actual causality behind our states of happiness and pain. We dont want our loved ones to leave us, but that is never predictable.

Thus, we are developing a diminishing sense of achievement. Nowadays, people are struggling a lot to have a beautiful and fulfilling life so much so that they have stopped admiring their own accomplishments. 

Efforts have lost their meaning as there is a lot to be accomplished. Nowadays, efforts are putting more people into disdain. For even those whe achieve - in terms of romantic relationship, or professional success, or acquiring skillset - they forget to celebrate. Soon after, they develop new goals to run after, or go into fear mode due to insecurity of losing it.

With Knowledge comes the responsibility of acting wiser. But due to the exhaustion - humans as a whole are facing, primarily because of the bombardment of information, there is tendency of increasing stress and unreliable behaviour. All in all our worldly knowledge is not proving to be helpful in mental well being.
