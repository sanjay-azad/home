# Stress

The gain in technology, and our ever increasing attempts at understanding life and its factors through worldly knowledge is not just being unhelpful with our mental wellbeing, but are also detrimental.

The more we put efforts and the lesser we celebrate our achievements, the more we are falling in the vicious circle of losing self worth, existential crisis, stress, psychological ailments resulting in bodily afflictions.

The kind of losses and uncertaintive we have today are not new. They have always been there. But the distress is new. The desperation is new. Agree that there is lot more competition among people, but there is competition among the new fields of work that you can do and feel piviledged and accomplished.

In many cases, the increasing stress levels is a direct result of air, water and noise pollutions. 

But recently screens are putting more than the desired level of stress into humans. We feed on screens for knowledge, entertainment, and convenience, but it can take extreme form of addiction. When there is a realization of time wasted on internet, if shoots up our strees level. 

Stress is good to put us directed. But constant stress spike can cost us our health. Not to mention the contents that our youngsters are watching, and fuelling to the immoral behaviour and a degradation in the dignity of boys and girls, is being catered by screens. Boys feel stress over wastage of their precious sperm after watching some half naked girls dance, and in the same way girls feel stress for being noticed or not noticed online.

Human's interaction and communication through personal touch has shifted over screens. Parents need to know operating smartphone to be connected to their tech-savy children with ease. This is a transition period of generations - with technology becoming more relevant nowadays, adding more stress to both the generations. New generation is heavily reliant on technology without a sense of direction. No doubt why Al is getting prominence.
