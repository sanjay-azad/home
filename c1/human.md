# The Need of the hour

I am writting this in the year 2023. We are living in an age where there is abundance of information. We are overwhelmed by new information or knowledge mere with the flick of fingers. All we have to do is to process that in our brains, keep some good enough memory, and transform the information into understanding.

With this new found understanding, we are equipped to adventure into the unknown and explore ideas, criticise things and optimize the workflows. 

We are getting deeper and deeper understanding of our sorroundings and enviroment along with our own brain and psychology. This is what primarily we have been doing since the dawn of the Human evolution. Every adventure, enterprise, and all sorts of co-operation & entrepreneurship have come into existence, and being driven by the same process.

In past few decades, the rate of this process has manifolded. The billions of people on Earth are collectively knowing stuff, thanks to our culture of sharing and inquiring.

We, as Humans are doing brilliantly good. We have found cures of lethal diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, we could outperform a recent pandemic - Corona, we are exploring exoplanets - not just our Moon, and Mars. Our telescopes are looking far and wide to the extremes of the observable universe - looking back into time, studying evolution of galaxies and getting to see the black holes. Artificial Intelligence is achieving new heights daily. 

We have developed Language models in AI. The learning we acquired around verbal communication over thousands of years - we are able to impart it to a machine by just few years of research and trainings.

Basically the collective effort of Humans over a considerable period of time is bearing fruits now.

No doubt there is much to be explored, vast expanse of things outside our reach. But we have started to achieve and we are achieving quickly. It's not just about technological feat, but about arriving at a collective consciousness and intellect. We have discarded bloodshed and war, have systematic approach for transactions removing any threat of immorality and cheating. We are aware about privacy, we devise mechanism, contracts, and laws to make the best out of society. 

Basically we are fulfilling what all our ancestors desired so dearly to have - controlling the nature, removing the factor of fear from aus daily lives, generating a sense of achievement, moving more towards pleasure and minimising the probabilities of disappointments. 

And we are doing this recklessly. As if we are on steroids. Maybe we are on autopilot. Memory and itellect are guiding us to extract more meaning - striving for a convenient world.

The thing is that the uncertainties and chaos we are living in is huge. So, that kind of response from an intellectually advanced civilization is more than expected. It's all an attempt to removing fears and insecurities from our lives.
