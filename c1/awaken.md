# Awakening

We have to stop running an an auto-pilot mode. Although subconscious cognition and decision making is very much crucial for our development and existence, but with due respect to the subconscious mind, we have to review and recognize how our subconscious has been fed. 

It's good to minimise energy wastage on proper thinking and decision making in our day-today tasks. But once we start becoming aware, we start losing the urge to frame things in our boundary, we start realising that the boundary we have created through our subconciens identifications is the cause of many of our sufferings.

I am not directing here on mindless and tiresome thinking that is nowadays called overthinking. But being present in the moment is the *key*. 

There are few points to ponder over: 

- Existence is what there is.

- Instead of thinking in terms of good and bad, think in termy of randomness and chaos, as these are what that make up the existence 

- You are not the body, mind or emotions

- You are the witness. 

- Most of our stress and illusion comes from how are perceive time

- Distinction between knowledge and awareness. Knowledge will always the limited as the universe keep on charging forms and complexity. It's the awareness that allows things to happen & settle 

- Limits in the time perceived limits all our knowlege and that puts boundary in our thinking. This in tern puts us into fear of unknown and insecurity towards the uncertain

- We, choosing complexity over simplicity is stright-away coming from our subconscious driving majority of our day 

- Complexity arise in our life because of the convenience we have choosen in the past

- Telling a lie to oneself or to others stem from choosing convenience over simplicity, and it distorts mind, body and energy 

- Our perceivable universe is defined by randomness, which is defined by change. Time is the canvas of change (or the essence of it). To define anything that our senses perceive, we need to define time.

- Our senses, ie, bodily openings constitute a miniscule amount of information, compared to the vast wisdom that our intution carries 

- Time cannot be sensed. It is geting experienced
