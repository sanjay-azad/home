# Convenience vs Simplicity

Convenience results into complexity. We have to see and audit ourselves, how our desires of convenience have turned out and where it has put us. Isn't it adding to the more complexity - which is not that much convenient what we imagined. 

We have stopped romanticizing simplicity - because we want instant solution, and greater gratification.

Simple is not convenient, it demands effort. We are ready for the effort - but with the intention of making our lives on the planet easier. With that short term goal we take several decisions that add up to the complexity of our existence, and we realise that the ease of living it not so simple. 

Had we focussed on the simple things - like nature, and not cared much about our own selfish convenience, we could have left more of the planet for future generations and obtained more contentment with our effortful living. 

Take for the example - agriculture. When we are heavily invested in profit making, we rob the soil of nutrients. It is making human domesticated by asking for maintenance and neading protection from theft and animals. Moreover, there are feuds over land. So it is adding more complexity, and a mental harassment compared to the forager lifestyle.

Convenience is the structure principle - coming out of our limited knowledge. Simplicity is the randomness principle - open to exploration and aware of the consequences of our actions.
