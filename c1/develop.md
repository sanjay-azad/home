# Unsustainable development

Some of our efforts have started showing signs of unsustainability. The progress we have made, the paths we have taken as a species, and the conditionality of nature or cosmos - all might be having some contribution towards the impending dangers to the life supporting nature as well as our own species. 

when we talk of sustainable development, it asks for the judicious use of resources. Optimal, efficient and skillful usage is what that we have recognized as the desired trait - be it economic activity or our day to day life. Overuse and wastage is what we have to avoid - be it natural resources or food that we eat.

But all of these words are highly convoluted and subjective - not having a definite meaning.

They change their meaning - subjective to economic backgrond, demography, region (geography), the utility of the project at hand, and time - obviously. Spending millions of rupees on projects like *Chandrayan* and *Mangal* mission to make a giant leap into understanding the Universe might be debatable at a time when we have millions of malnourished children at home.

How much usage of water daily is good enough for region like India and Africa? The availability of water decides that. Richness decides the threshold.

We talk of globalized world and global economy, but it takes economic efforts to put resources from one place to the other.

We are destroying nature - that is evident from the climate change and unbearable heat from the sun. This is destroying wildlife and putting species at risk of endangering. Our intellect is at play when we think of ourselves as superior to other animals. Possibly we are - intellectually, but we climbed the ladder of food chain so quickly that we have completely lost the sense oof good and bad. 

Even in economic terms most of our actions are debatable - usage of vehicles, air-conditioner, eating meat, wellness products, nuclear power, space projects, medicines and side effects, eating processed foods - like refined flour and oil, having cold drinks. We dont know what's good and bad - thats why so much confusion, fear and unsustainable behaviour.

Technology, intellect, human endeavors, and adventurism are not to be blamed completely. They are a very good facilitator for the increasing entropy of the universe. The more we know, the more we try out different things, changing aur perception and perspective completely. 

The existence of things and ideas are not good or bad unto themselves. It's how we approach them, the way or methods/means employed to achieve them, or to materialize them, or to extract greater meaning out of them that turns out to be good or bad.

The existence is what there is - born out of the chaos of Universe. No existence can harm anybody as it is completely deterministic.

But how we interact with it, how we employ it, and what somebody acquires out of it is going to be the game-changer as it is completely will power driven (in worldly behaviour at least).

So what is needed? We need awakening.

 A shift from worldly knowlege to a universal awareness. Then only we can take better decisions, be confident about good and bad, eliminate fear, develop understanding, and enjoy greater predictability - thus removing of stress and anxiety. 
 
 Informed decisions are good but what are the sources of information? We put humans at risk with our ill informed decisions.
