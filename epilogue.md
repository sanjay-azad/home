# Randomness and Structure

It is a well known and well accepted belief that: 'Moderation is the virtue'. But I don't align with that. Where does this 'moderation' lie is the real question. The objectivity of 'moderation' across geographies, culture, personalities, and economies is in question.

How much of daily usage of water is 'moderate'? Ask an African and an Indian.

We frequesntly encounter such questions nowadays as to which is better: Socialism or Capitalism?
We debate and discuss liberalism and conservatism. What about left vs. right?

Why do you think just two political parties were enough to run the US governments since 300 years? We are talking about hundreds of millions of people just settling with the two ideologies: democrates and republics. In India, there's an extreme polarity among the lefts and the rights.

These are beliefs - that are hardened and solidified.

These all are some examples of the two facets of the human personalities. These two sides are a reflection of the complexity of human motivations and capture the human standpoint.
Every one of us lie in this spectrum - left to right, or liberal to conservative. That's what political parties are encashing.
Recognizing and understanding this dual nature can lead to a more nuanced and wholistic perspective on human behavior.

Scientific and religious beliefs are a similar duality.

This duality is societal, reflecting the imagination of each and every individual - and this finds place in the political game to ride on the human tendencies.

Each if the above mentioned polarities can be captured into the randomness and structure form of polarity. You may say that how is this adding any value? It is another wording of the distinction and one can always argue that 'entropy' is better unifying force, and is what governing everything : material or ideological. But the above polarity is going to settle the debate as it highlights the fallacy of human behaviour and puts the agency in them.

How do we say that liberal secularism is better or religious conservatism? How do we identify if our belief in a capitalist democracy is giving good result compared to the socialist dictatorship?

There are a few cues - freedom of the society is always good and opression is always bad. When science gives freedom to think and criticize, and religion binds - the choice is simple.
But what if science impacts the nature in unhealthy & non-reversible way, and religions hold the society together?

Equality is good, but it gives rise to a situation of tussle & dispute, compared against the systematic discrimination of the past. Some practices and beliefs are dogma to some and perfectly acceptable to the other. Eating rats is a reality of the 'Musahar' community of India, whereas a deadly sight to some its residents. Vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism is a similar debate - former loathing and the latter mocking the other. Hence, the trouble and debate ensues.

Putting each of the duality into the dualism of randomness and structure is an attempt to remove the chaotic struggle.

Randomness is the concept of free will, intution and infinite possibilities. Structure is the principle of categories and hardened rule and limited possibilities. It is deterministic. Randomness is complex to understand and structure can be highly simple and dogmatic.

Humanity is stuck between randomness and structure because we want to know, but we fear the unknown and we want the comfort of the structure.

Freedom is good - but reckless free decisions are harmful to the society, as humans are fraught with corrupted behaviours. That's why we need the backing of conservative ideas and support systems as we embrace the randomness of liberal ideas and beliefs.

It is also interesting that randomness and structure lie in all of the beliefs - whether capitalist or socialist, and left or right.

Being too much structured in your belief like capitalism gives dogmas like exploitative economy, and embracing the randomness supports free trade and rely on the invisible hand to adjust the prices and competitions.
