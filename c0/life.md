# Life & living things

Upto this point we have considered Humans only in our imagination. Without loss of generality, all the previous concepts can be extended to all other life forms - who have senses, intellect, conciousness.

Humans might be having higher intellect compared to all other species present on Earth. But nothing can be said surely about the other two properties. If we consider the Universe or the multiverse we can understand that Humans are not at the centre - what generally believe in. There are multiple levels of lifehood present among multitude of species known or unknown.

But what is the definition of life or how do we distinguish between a living and non-living entity? More importantly can we have an exhaustive notion of lifehood?

You might have heard these thoughts that the Universe is a living entity as a whole and that each and every particle has God in it. How do we digest these and bring them in context?

These are some questions that make us wander through the concepts of willpower and determinism - without a fruitful response. 

One can argue that all living beings have the will power, whereas the non-living elements possess a deterministic nature.
But the above reasoning may fail if we can make intelligent artificial agents whose outputs are not deterministic, but probabilistic. Acting in probabilistic terms is similar to having a will power. If the actions of the agent are mot explainable to a good degree (incomprehensible), then it can be claimed to have will power.

Similarly on the other hand, the chaos theory tells the events in the Universe are happening on the basis of the increasing entropy tendency. Hence, nothing is deterministic even in planetary motion. 

It is better to say that they are driven by will power to follow a set of orbits and trajectory. The same can be said in quantum domain.

Thus, some scientific measures of lifehood has to be relied upon. Few are: characteristic life processes like respiration, excretion, reproduction. But since they are mostly present in artificial systems, so we take the crux of them:
- Information passing through genes
- Evolution strategy (own perspective), change (external perspective) for survival and growth

Life is strongly associated with the Nature and the creation theories of the Universe.
The living beings too show duality in their way of existence. They have conciousnes through which they witness the sorrounding. They have a knowlege transfer mechanism to effect the surrounding.

The *Purusha-Prakriti* duality (energy and conciousness) mentioned in the Sankhya darshan as well as in the Kashmir Shaiviam tells the necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of life.

Even our own cells are living or dead, and there exist life forms in cellular level only like amoeba. The point is that we humans are not of the centre. There must exist life in cosmic and particle levels too. We just have to be aware of the conciousness around us.

Hence, it is not wrong to say that the cosmos is a living entity and the very life force breathing life in it can also fuel the life in a particle. We have no way to tell now that the moon or the Earth is living but that is completely possible.
