Humane might be having higher intellect compared to all other species present 6xth. But nothing can be said surely about the other 2 properties if we consider the Universe or the mully verse we can understand that Humans are not at the centre what generally believe in There are multiple levels. of lifehood present amory multitude of species Хноши о unknown

But what is the definition of life or how do we disting wish between a More importantly of lifehood.? living have and non- -living entity? a exhaustive notion.

You might have heard these thoughts that the Universe i a living entity as a whole and that each and every particle has had in it. How do we digut these and bring them in context ?

These are some questions that make us wander through the concepts of will I power and determiniem. - without- Que fruit full response can arme that all living beings have the will power. whereas the men living elements possess deterministic nature. a

But the above reasoning may fail sometime if we can make intelligent artificial agents whore outputs. are not deterministic, but probabilistic Act Acting in probabilistic terms is similar to having will power If the actions of the agent are mot explainable to a good depree (incomprehensible), than it can be claimed to have will power.

Similarly on the other hand, the chase theory telle the va events in the Univ. happenly on the boste of the increasing entropy tendency Mence nothing is deterministic even in planetary motion. It is better to say that they are driven by will power to follow a set of orbits and bajectory: 1. The same be in quantum demain

Thus some scientific mentures of lifehood hair fo be relied opon now are characteristic life processes like - But since they respiantion, excretion, reproduction. are mostly present in artificial system. So we take the crux of them a 1) information passing through games

2) Evolution Stackedy (from their own. perspecting? change in outlook (from entide) for survival and growth

life is strongly associated with the Nature and the creation thrones of the Inirerse.

So the living things too show way of existence - duality in this 1 they have conciousnes through which they

The energy and conciaviness duality mentioned in the Sankhya darshan and Purusha - Brakotti duality also present in Kashmir Shaiviam tell the the necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of life. there

Even our own cells are living or dead, and the exist life forms in cellular level only like amoeba. The point is that we mans are not of the extitre. There must- exist life in cosmic and partide levels too. We just have to be aware of the concioueners around us.

Hence, it is not wroly to say that the cormor is a living entity and the very life force breathing life in it We have no living can also fuel the life in a particle. way to tell now that the meson or the Earth but that it completely possible.
