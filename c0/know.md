# Knowledge

In literal sense Vidya means Knowledge. We have talked much about Knowledge as something originating out of awareness by the conciousness aspect. 

This knowledge can be absolute or limited depending upon who is witnessing (or observing). When it is the individual self filled with fear and Aham (ego), the Knowlege acquired is limited. When it is the Supreme self that is obtaining Knowledge by just being aware that's called absolute knowledge.

Here we can introduce two new concepts:
- Bhagvad drishti
- Vyavharik drishti

Hindi speakers would know the meaning instantly. 
The former means witnessing like a God - undisturbed and non-judgemental, free from own benefit.
The latter means practical and/or actionable observation that involves logic, reasoning and judgement.

All these dualities that are coming up might feel totally opposite - but need a wholistic view to see them as complementary. It's not that we are imcomplete without one of the other. But to know the word completely, we have to know its two sided meaning.

In this sense, Maya or Avidya are not negative things (although many times used in negative sense). Negative and positive comes out of the objective. Our objective is to know, so things just have to be the way they are.

Thus knowledge too has dual nature: selfish & altruistic. But two faces of the same coin - something beyond partial Knowlage.

Here, it becomes important to talk about the sources of knowledge as has been described by our ancient thinkers. Knowing is a process of observing and absorbing something. With Knowledge comes information to be acted upon by the mind.

There are 5 sense organs that act as the basic sources of knowledge. Then there is intution which is beyond physical realm, and which comes through pure awareness.

Then there is intellect that acts upon the information to transform it into understanding. So in the duality of knowledge space, there are two things only:
- Awareness
- Intellect

Sense, Intution, Information, and Understanding develop out of them.
