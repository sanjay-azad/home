# Knowledge

In literal sense 'Vidya' in Hindi means Knowledge. We have talked much about the 'Knowledge' as something originating out of awareness by the consciousness aspect. 

This knowledge can be absolute or limited depending upon who is witnessing (or observing). When it is the individual self filled with fear and *Aham* (ego / limited identities), the knowlege thus acquired is limited. When it is the Supreme self that is deriving knowledge by its nature of awareness that's called the absolute or true knowledge.

Here we can introduce two new concepts:
- Bhagvad drishti
- Vyavharik drishti

Hindi speakers would know the meaning instantly. 
The former means witnessing like a God - undisturbed and non-judgemental, free from personal benefits and desires.
The latter means practical and/or actionable observation that involves logic, reasoning, judgement and desires.

In all our interactions and transactions - we can either keep *Bhagvad drishti* or *Vyavharik drishti*, or both!

All these dualities that are coming up might feel totally opposite - but need a wholistic view to see them as complementary. It's not that we are imcomplete without one or the other. But to know the word completely, we have to know its two sided meaning.

In this sense, Maya or Avidya are not negative things (although many times used in negative sense in Indian philosophy). Judgement of negative and positive comes with an observer and his agenda or the objective. Our objective is to know, so things just have to be as they are in the existence.

Thus knowledge too has dual nature: selfish & altruistic. But two faces of the same coin - something beyond partial knowledge.

Here, it becomes important to talk about the sources of knowledge as has been described by our ancient thinkers. Knowing is a process of observing and absorbing something. With Knowledge comes information to be acted upon by the mind.

There are 5 sense organs that act as the basic sources of knowledge. Then there is intution which is beyond physical realm, and which comes through pure awareness.

Then there is intellect that acts upon the information to transform it into understanding. So in the duality of knowledge space, there are two things only:
- Awareness
- Intellect

Sense, Intution, Information, and Understanding develop out of them.
