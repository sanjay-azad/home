# Awareness

In the common English usage, it means - knowing stuffs. Although *knowing* has to be defined but we get the idea. Awareness gives us a better control over our decision making. It helps us model the world as close as possible. It means being accessible to all sorts of inputs that the universe has to offer.

Now, there are two faces to the meaning of the word: 

- Being immersive (in-the-moment):

When we talk about approaching anything in life with a sense of involvement then it hints at awareness coming as a result of putting effort into the object and showing up to it. Not being dismissive to any thought, person or opportunity, keeping the door of possibility open comes in immersive awareness.

- Being the *Drsta* (putting onself out of the situation):

When we talk of not getting entangled with pain & pleasure, we mean the awareness coming from the a bird's eye view - witnessing what is taking place. This concept looks opposite to the concept of getting deep & involved into the present moment. But they both talking of the same experience.

How are they both complementary?
Present moment is important in physical as well as spiritual domain. Physically - only the present is in our control, spiritually - this moment is infinitesimally small, and when we magnify it - we get to live it as fully as possibly with total awareness. This state in spritual world is termed as being the *Drsta* or the knowing Self.

The concept of *Drsta* was revealed in the *Ashtavakra Gita*, and the *Yogic* practices talk of the immersive experience of life.
In the spiritual domain, awareness leads us to enlightenment and that enlightenment gets us to know the complete reality.

The altruist nature of awareness is in being the *Drsta* and the selfish nature is in the sense of involvement with life. Here, we should have come to realize that 'selfish' is not a bad word (Although good and bad are coming from *Avidya* or illusion concept).

All forms of meditation and focussing on one's breath comes under immersive kind of awareness. It is refered as selfish way, as here we deal with something we already know and experience the resulting awareness. Identifying the real self in us - which is all observing and never changing, and getting rid of the changing self or unreal identities (which is the source of dissatisfaction) comes under the alruist side of awareness to know the reality of existence.
