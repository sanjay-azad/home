## Awareness

In the common English usage, it means - knowing stuffs. Although 'knowing' has to be defined but we get the idea. 

Now, how the duality comes is that there are two faces of the meaning of the word: 

- Being immersive / in-the-moment: 
When we talk about approaching anything in life with a sense of involvement then it hints at awareness coming as a result of putting effort into the object and showing up to it. Not being dissiesive to any thought, person or opportunity, keeping the door of possibility open that any of them can put us to higher awareness (closeness to God or Reality).

- Being the *Drsta* / Putting onself out of the situation:
When we talk about not getting entangled, we mean the awareness coming from observing and taking a step back. This concept is complementary to the concept of getting deep into the present moment. Present moment is important in physice domain, but when constraint it - we try to live it as fully as possibly with all awareness. This state in spritual world is termed as being the *Drsta* or the knowing Self.


In the spiritual domain, awareness leads us to enlightenment and that enlightenment gets us to know the complete reality.

The altruist nature of awareness is in being the *Drsta* and the selfish nature is in the sense of involvement with life. Here, we should have come to the realization that selfish is not a bad word (Although good and bad are coming from *Avidya* concept).

All forms of meditation and focussing on one's breath comes under immersive kind of awareness. It is reffered as selfish way, as here we deal with something we already know and wait for the realization to come. Identifying the real self in us and getting rid of the individual self (which is bevause of the ego or *Aham*) comes under the alruist side of awareness to know the realization or enlightenment.
