# Consciousness

The literal meaning in Hindi and Sankrit is *chitta* or *chetana* - the perceiving entity in us. It is sometime referred to as the *Atman (Atma)*, Self or Soul. 
Scientifically, we dont know what 'consciousness' is. It could be related to brain, mind or intelligence - we don't know. It could be resulting from higher and higher intelligence as it denotes an independent agency or volition.

In some of the Indian philosophies, the universe is all pervading with *Consciousness*. It is the *Purusha*, or *Brahman*, or the *chetana* element of creation.

To understand this duality of consciousness in *us*, vs the consciousness of the universe, we have to define its 2 faces:
- the Individud self - talking about the individual agencies
- the Supreme self (Ultimate Reality) - talking about the sum total agency or the guiding volition of the universe

Now, the context is that both refer to the same subject, but in a sense, are completely opposite.

The Individul 'self' is filled with ego, *Aham*, and fear. While, the Supreme 'Self' is free from atachments and is itself the Sat-Chit-Ananda (True-pure-joy).

In worldly terms, the entity that is perceiving all is the individual soul/self as it has not achieved realization. After the self becomes truly aware, it attains the *Param Shiva* or *Brahman* state and is something in spritual domain. The entiity is same, usage might vary.

We have to understand that we are neither mind, nor body nor senses, nor brain, nor ego, nor intellect. These are all the acquired things. Then what are We?

It is something at the core of all of these - something that is driving them, extracting meaning out of their interactions, all perceiving and the essence of awareness. That is called Consciousness.

It is easy to confuse mind with the consciousness. But when we identify mind to be constituted of thoughts, emotions and memories, we see that it has no authority of its own. They can come and subside - it is 'I' who is witnessing them all. So, without the loss of generality, the scriptures and Indian philosophers claim that it is the Consciousness which has illuminated the whole world and witnessing itself (more on this later).

While we are at this, we should also explore the terms - atma / atman / soul. In my view, these are just the selfish aspects of the all pervading and ever knowing reality of the Universe having a veil of illusion or Avidya. When we refer to Brahman / Shiva, we refer to the altruistic aspect of the same uncaused cause that we call as God / *Ishwara*. 

The Ultimate Reality is the knowledge that the individual self obtains when confronted with the God or *Ishwara*. Now, the souls are many - in physical or selfish domain. The Avidya results into a feeling of separateness from others, consequently giving rise to feelings of attachment, desires and fear. 

The true reality has been hidden to us (the individual selves) by the *Maya* aspect or the veil. That's why what all we are perceiving in physical domain as universe has been called Avidya.
