# Enlightenment

This word has been referred to as by many names - mukti, liberation, realization, nirvana, and many more, and has been prescribed to be the ultimate goal of oneself - by many scriptures and sages. The realization of the utimate or the supreme knowledge has been sought to be the purpose of mankind (or any life form to say) and the true objective of beings.

The above terms may have slight variations in their meanings and usage, as they originate from different cultures / religions / geographies.

Eg. Mukti means freedom - from the bondage of *Karma*, from the cycles of life and death. It is of primary concern in Hinduism as it deals with rebirths and Karma theory at its centre. Realization is rather a philosophical word, finding usage in Indian *darshanas* - primarily dealing with Sanatana dharma, having references in *Vedas* and *Upanishads*. Nirvana is used in Buddhism to donate the attainment of real knowledge state by Lord Buddha.

Buddha literally means the one who has attained the Bodha (or the knowledge). This is similar to the realization principle of darshanas, where we have to witness the ultimate Reality or the God component, ie., Shiva/Brahman. Similar in the case of enlightement where the focus is on getting illuminated by the radiance of true Knowledge.

All of this is always accompanied with joy and bliss - as mentioned by great spiritual and scriptural souls. This is because the true Reality or the embodiment of the God is itself the *Paramananda* or the tree/ultimate joy that lasts forever (timeless).

The bliss obtained is beyond time and space boundary. The Mukti concept is also about being boundaryless. It talks of the soul or Jiva (individual self) journeying through life and death - suffering in each cycle, tormented by fear and limited knowledge and striving to unite with the soure/creator which it has separated (again ill knowledge). The soul is said to be the Supreme self - itself, but needs an encounter with the Reality to witness the God in itself. It doesn't come with Knowlede only. Experience is utmost here. Through knowledge of the Self, one experiences oneness with the God.

Awakening and liberation are used to denote the same encounter with the true Reality.
But are these some state of being or some process? Where does duality come here?

In my view the state is called *Sthita-Pragya*, the established one - that is achieved after we thave attained enlightenment or realization. 

So, basically the words I am talking about are denoting a process, rather than a state in themselves. The process is about going from some place (limited knowlege) to the other place (true knowledge).

This is a transition from the 'Known" territory to the 'Unknown'!!

Now, here is the duality - the *Known* & the *Unknown* both of which are traversed by the Seeker during the process of realization / enlightenment. The state that is achieved after getting to know the complete reality - is Unitary: *Sthita-Pragya*. So the known and unknown are equally important for a person on the path to liberation. This justifies the means of *Saguna* (in-forms) worship while maintaing that the end of the truth is in *Nirguna* (formless).

Somebody has to start from the *Known* or something with properties, like idols, symbols, or even metaphors. The *Unknown* is devoid of proporties, that is incomprehensible. The words cannot reach there, the mind and intellect cannot fathom it.

Once we start saying anything about the true Knowledge - it does not remein true, because we have put it in our conception / words / feelings / properties.

For an individual Self, the self realization is always beyond 'known' and it is a process of remembrance rather than achievement or getting there. By remembrance we mean it is always there - undisturbed and ever present form. We just have forgotten about it.

Now with this understanding, and with the acknowledgment that the words cannot reach 'unknown' or *Nirguna*, lets start our journey from the known - relying on limited knowledge and identifying the process from the limited knowledge to the true knowledge. In this journey, we'll rely on Intellect, Nature, Consciousness and Science.
