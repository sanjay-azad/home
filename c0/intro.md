# Introduction

In the spiritual domain, there is a great scarcity of words. Each and every word that we use has to be defined properly, otherwise there is confusion - mismatch in the meanings across different linguist groups as well as the unclear concepts because of the usage of those words in our day-to-day life without going deeper in their meanings and profoundity.

Science has also sought to explain phenomena and for that it has also coined some terms. Similarly the terms used in philosophy or spirituality need proper scientific definitions. But the task is not so easy - putting down 'experience' into limited understanding of language.

Some commonly used terms:

Awareness     |  Atman
Conciousness  |  God
Knowledge     |  Maya
Information   |  Observation
Enlightenment |  Reality
Living or Life|  Jad and Chetan


The premise is that- only if we could understand or comprehend these few words fully, then we can attain greater insights into the philosophy and thoughts (darshanas) that our great sages and thinkers have left us. The thoughts are all arounds us. Our understanding mostly depends upon the definitive understanding of those words.

At the same time, we should also realize that- the incompleteness of our knowledge or understanding might also be hidden in those words only - and in the incompleteness of their meanings. 

There is an understanding that these words are from this world only, they cannot elaborate what's beyond. This is generally referred to *Avidya* (limited knowledge). Hence, silence has been told to contain greater meaning compared to clattering. Still when we are putting the knowledge down, we should aspire to be as much aligned as possible.

The reality always have two facets - and both complemantary ones. You can treat it as a dualist principle, but again - a dualism contained inside a non-dual context (more on this in Indian philosophy). It's like two faces of a same coin. If you are concerned about the face - they are two. But if you are concerned about the totality and the system - then there is one.

Generally, the two faces can be characterised by below properties:
- Altruist face / randomness principle 
- Selfish face / structure principle

Let me give some examples: 

When we aspire to do something, we are generally motivated by the demand of the situation to put us to work. But you will do it only when there is something for you in store. You might attribute the human psychology (corruption) for this fact but it exists in various other knowledge and even in defining the spiritual words mentioned previously.

- True transparency comes with revealing selfieh motives too
Talking about transparency, you always put quation mark about the motivation behind the other person's intentions while coming together in a co-operative enviroment. Unless the other person reveals their selfish motive (no matter they mentioned false or fake motive), you cannot know them completely. 

So knowing them required knowing two faces - altruist & selfish.
With this background - let's new come to the point of defining the words:
