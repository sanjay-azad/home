# Time as Illusion

We are always running in the physical world for time management. It is slipping away of our fists like sand. With time we age and go to death. It is limited in our life as well as in all the projects that we do. We have to be efficient to achieve more a given time.

Because there is death, because there is end, we enjoy the beauty of the process, we enjoy the life and yet it is slipping away. Whatevey our endeavors are, whatever we may be talking about - time will always come into picture. It is not existing but making us run like a ghost does.


Time - which is divided between past, present and future is a major hindrance in knowing anything fully. It makes our knowledge relative, and limited. Time exists because the environment is an interplay of observations of a network of observers. The subjects are also observing. All these movements, and vibrations is because of the all conscious observers, observing in a network - thus experiencing change and evolution of the system/nature.

In the ultimate reality there is just one conscious observer which is beyond the three separations of time. It is everpresent and all knowing. When there is no time, there is no change, and an infinite knowledge.

In our lives, we experience good times and bad times. There are ups and downs as we continue the journey. This gives us a sense of cycle. We have pains and pleasures, and they come and go, and come back again. The time we enjoy passes so quickly, but not so with the painful times. The trouble is that we cannot even predict when this bad time will end.

We understand that it's all in our mind - but still fall into geting swayed by the time. There shall come a time when you extremely joyous because of the presence of a special someone. You would want to cherish each and moment every you spend with them. But soon you are separated and you develop all sorts of fear, jealousy and mistrust for them, making you fall into an utter dispair for sometime. Then you continue your life slightly moving on from the torture. 

Then one day - after sometime they made their way back again into your life - all jolly and cheerful. You are relieved for they uplified your mood and you both are happy. 

Thus, you start questioning the relevance of the period you spent lamenting in their separation. You realize that they did not give you the pain but it was the time that was painful.

That's the story of human life. All pains and happiness lose value because of their momentary nature. This cyclical nature of time is the reason of our misery and anxiety. 

And we do all sorts of things to remain on the top of time. We do insurance, we do investments, and we do agreements in relationship just to avoid this volatile nature of time and its injustices. But by doing so we avoid the pleasures of the randomness of things too.

When we encounter an accident, we question - why we went through that moment in that space? Life really does go by in the blink of an eye.

Sometimes, we cling to the time we have because we know that it is limited. But once everything is over we start questioning the relevance of that time. Was our running at all relevant? 

The future is not known, and this raises a question of relevancy over the past. All we are left with is now - the present moment. It only make the past relevant and defines the future. 

So try to align your mind, body and energy into the present moment - as often as possible.
