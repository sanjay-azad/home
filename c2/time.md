# The Exploration of Time

Events happen as we *observe* - and it gives us a sense of time, moving in one direction from the past to the present. Time is always flowing and it never stops for anybody. The future is revealed as present and the present goes into the memory as past. 

This is how we humans perceive time. We are not sure about the animal kingdom of they have any sense of it as they observe. 

Things happen in a sequence for a particular observer (observation happens through all senses), and the backdrop/canvas that makes the sequence visible is the time. This makes me wonder about the existence of time at a place which is devoid of events/happenings. The exitence of such a system is imagined to be pre big-bang only - which consisted of the Singularity and it was surely devoid of time. 

A syetem being devoid of time is not just because it is devoid of space - hence no events happening, but it is equally because there is no observer to witness the sequence of events.

Time is scientifically proven to be relative - as is everything we are dealing with in the physical world.

Time is an integral part of physics. Everything here in physical domain that we are perceiving through senses is relative, ie, not absolute. Relativity is with respect to the system we are considering, and the observer. We call it *frame of reference* that captures both.

It was well known during Newton's time that the space is relative. Later, with Einstein it became clear that the time too is relative - not just in terme of perception but as a physical phenomenon too. The atomic clocks too behave differently at different settings.

We have measures of time like seconds, days, years, yugas and kalpas. We spend lives bounded inside the time frame of some 70 to 90 years. But in terms of experiences, those years mean different levels of fulfillment to different individuals. So, there is infinity among the finiteness of the Time. It's like real numbers. An infinity of possibilities between a fraction of a second. 

A fraction of a second can be infinitesimly small. When somebody talks of the present moment - what fraction of second is it made up of? Because beyond that fraction there are pasts and futures. Without the loss of generality, it can be said that the same nothingness present in the moment when time tends to zero can be pervading through the yugus and kalpas.
