# The exploration of time


Events happen at we observe- and it giver as a sence of time, moving in one direction from past to preant- Time is always flowing and it never stops for any bundy The future is revealed as present and the prevent goes. inb memory past. This is how we humans perceive time. We are not sure

about the animal kingdom of they have any sense of

it as they observe. Things happen in a sequence for a particular observer Call senses) and the backdrop/canvas that makes the sevence visible is the time. This makes me wonder about the existence of time at a place which is devoid of events/ happenings the exilence of such a imagined to be pre bly-bang only - which comited system is of singularity and I was surely devoid of time. A syetem being devoid of time is not andy because it is devoid of space-hence no events happening, but it is equally because theme is no observer to witness the sequence of events.

Time is scentifically proven to be seletiver as is everything dealing with in physical world.

Time is an integral part of physics. Everything have in physical domain that we are perceiving through senses is relative, ie, not absolute. Relativity is wat. the Isystem, we are considering and the observer. We call it 'frame of reference that captuses both..

It was well known during Newton's time that the space. is relative Lakes of the time with Einstein if became clear that the time too is relative - not int in terme of perception but as a physical phenomenon too. The atomic clocks too behave differently at different Seltinys

we have measures of time like seconds, days, yeare and Jugas. We spend lives bounded inside the time frame of some 70 to 90 years. But in teams of experiences, those years mean different devels of fulfillment to different individuals. So there & in. infinity amory the infinitenen of the Time. It's like real numbers.

An infinity of possibilities between a A fraction of second pened of I see. can be infiniterimily small. when somebody talke of present moment - what fraction of second it is made up of ?

Because beyond that there are past and fortires. wlog, the same nothingness be pervading through сам Yugus and Kalpas, that is there when to
