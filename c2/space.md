# Space and time

Time is born out of space, and the space is governed by the time.

Imagine yourself immersed in the nothingness of the Universe. You might be in total dark where nothing is moving. There is a demonic silence too. Would experience any seqence of events? No! 

Does the concept of time holds value there? 

Space, and the phenomena in there give rise to time. Today time has become physical - as measured though clocks and calendars, and they too require a reference point: origin. 

We are able to perceive and operate in a 3-dimensional world in space. We are not able to imagine or visualize in higher dimensional spaces, but we have mathematics which can capture all sorts of dimensions.

For time dimension, what we can perceive is that we are moving in forward direction only automatically.
In space, we can choose to move but we are moving forward in time at each instant. 

When the observer moves, it sees a new reality - new perspective.

Hence, there ia a great attempt at knowing the future. The configuration of the subjects and the observer can be deterministic in space, but their configuration with respect to the time is very volatile and source of a great surprise.

Suppose you are walking in the woods and you encounter a building at the end of the road. You need time to move upto that point and see the reality of that place. Suppose there is also a bird sitting on the roof top but you did not see her. So you need to travel in space and time to bring her into your observation. What if the bird flew away before you reach there? The bird was there all the time, but she never came in our existence. Time was there but the space changed.

So our relative position, movement and configuration does not necessarily demands the presence of time. We can do teleportation and still have similar experiences. Still the time has been enforced upon us.

Time is the all powerful that it only creates beings, remains through them while they experience, witness and explore and then annihilates them. 

With time comes the age - child, young and old. It is so important that we have considered it to be a law of nature that nobody can betray or defeat time. Time only brings death and hence transforms the space.

Time exists because of a conscious being experiencing the reality. The process of observation is also being observed. The one doing this obervtation is called consciousnete or the *chetna*. 

If there is no observer, would there still be sequence of events happening? if there is a sequence there must be a conscious observer - be it living or non-living (as we call it today).

The process of observation is always accompanied with time. There must be a fraction of time lag for any change to be apparent. When there is a change, there is a flow. Thus, observation is a flow variable and not stock variable - ie, it cannot happen over infinitesimal small amount of time.
