2.1 Space and Time? Time is born out of space and the space is governed by time.

Imagine yourself immersed in the nothingness of the You might be in total dark where nothing is moving. There is a demonic silence too. Would experience any sepence of events? No! you

For time, what we can perceive is that jull- I-D moving in forward direction only natically, aufman In space, we can choose to move, but moving forward. in time at each instant when the observed money. they see a reality new perspective new reality

Hance there in a great attempt at knowing the film the configuration of subjects and the observer can be deterministic, but their confignioution wist the is very volatile and source of a great sempiose

Suppose you one walks encounter a walking in a woods and дли building at the end of the road. You need time to move puplo that point and see the reality of that place. suppose there is also a bird sitting on the roof top but- did not see huy you So you need to travel in space and time to bring hir imho your observation. What if the bird flew' away & before we reach there? the bird was these all the time, but she never there but the space changed. our existence

Time was

So our relative position, movement and configuration. does not necessarily demands the presence of time. We do teleportation and still have similar. experiences . Still time have been enforced on us

Teme is the all powerful that it only creaties beings,

The process of observation is always accompanied with time. There must be a fuction of time lager for any change to be mot apparent. When there is a a flow. There observation is a flow variabl stock variable - ie, it cannot happen over infinitesimal small amount of time.

22 Time as 11/weten: We are mangement always running in physical world for time. It is what that is slopping awary of ens fist like sand with time we and до to death. It is limited in our life as well as in all the projects that we de kk kave to be efficient to achieve mon a given time

Because there is death, because there is and enjoye the beauty of the precess, he enjoy the life and yet it is clipping away. Whatevey our andervers are, whatemy we are takin about- 1 time will always It is not existing but making talking come into picture.. as son lice a ghost does.
