# The role of gravity

At the event horizon near black holes, there in a infinite privily due to an infinity of mass. The the!!!!! gravity gave still lie, it is infinitely elongated. There woul be infinity of moments between two moments. However this dilation or contruction is relative to It may happen that un experience if the Rame way as me the perceive it here on Earth. The charge in perey ! would be apporrent if we could teleport bulk and f between Earthy and went horizon. But that would also consume some time

Relativity also talks about the variation of time with peed We have definite formula for how high speed clergates time menaly time get slower doing this formulas. clocks on as satellites are caliberated to match the

clocks on Earth Surface Thus our outer environment as well as our immer env both has a role in defining the time. But her do

they conieur or correlate? or do they really wordele. The essence of physice is that the frame of reference lecider how we perceive a phomanona/event and that also governs all our memurements and observiting to quantify. It would happen that at plates the FOR are different but the person experiences same thing l because it for biome a part of the system. Time becomes gast of the observer have the di a part differ

becomes visible if the observexe are fludied together af- I place at same time. The readings of impririle are takon by the conciermess It could b a living being. atoms in an atomic clock. That concibaugen sometime a part of the system whose demente if it witnessing, or sometimes outside that cyrlen. It play of systems only of which if we are not aware we would record an erroneous reading. All laws of physics start with a definition of the by dem if it talking || about. That means there is change in conelovenets off people al different FOR for how they are perceiving !!! same flow up evening when the rate was actually differ hat we have to look what flow of evente is? If our while really was just I pisson our flan if events resembled th rute of activity the perom seed be dang

What is time? What are we perceing metually as that we termed as event in our opening sentence. Is it a change in ether or aka that is the extence of all our sharps bause we fed there is no charge in how events ocuse even if what we are obsining chings speed in space. With this observation that any concioveney is relative, If becomes dear that nothing is real -raising sumpiosum. in every bit of our knowlege - thanks to time. This demands an identification of the Tusion.
