# Truth vs change

How do we say that what changed was not true?

It was true in the past, but not for the present self. And the self which is witnessing has not changed. With the above reasoning what is in the present but expected to change in future must also not be true as the self is going to be the same. If the perceiving self was diffrent, then the change was inevitable without commenting on the truth on falseness of the object. 

People come and die, flowers bloom and wither, civilizations flourish and get extinct. All these are changes perceivable to a constant self and are time dependent. A constant witnessing self is must in our previous discussion.

Thus, a natural thought arise that the existence is not true or completely illutions. It is the same reasoning through which we realise that our dreams are not true. We were there in dreams, things happened - we felt, we cried, we danced. It was full of adventures, we could even sense others with touch. But it has to end and that too abruptly. 

Coming to senses, we instantly know that all the sequences of the story were dream and not true. So when we annihilate the whole creation as illusion, we are missing out on one aspect - time. Time is the canvas of change. But yes there is another aspect of ill or limited knowledge at any given point of time. So what is truth? The dynamism of life is truth, the all pervading consciousness is the truth.
