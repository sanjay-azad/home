# Time and Forms

The previous discussion brings us at looking things in their innate form and going back in time upto the big bang when only the essence existed - that could be identified.

What we are essentially looking for is the Singularity in time and the pure essence in space. Time limits the eternity into past, present and future. Forms limit our sense of identification with properties, names and bodies. 

Both of these give rise to limited knowledge attraction and separateness and a compulsiveness of fate or destiny.

How to go beyond all those things? More importantly, is this really important to go beyond the things we just identified as the veil of Maya? 

Science have given us a lot of answers in understanding the natural phenomena and worldly affairs through physics, chemistry, and biology. We know the leaves are green due to a pigment called chlorophyll. We know it will fall off as it stops getting the needed biological input.

Is it really worth talking about something beyond its physicality, chemical composition, and biological process? No doubt there are mysteries in understanding the fundamental particles, quantum world, and far off distant galaxies that we have not uncovered through science. 

What is really bad in just knowing the exteriority and through sense perceptions is that - we don't know the real intention of why it was put there. We remain clueless about the purposs of the existence. No doubt there are psychology, philosophy. sociology who are probing into such unknowns.


There are mythologies creating larger than life and highly idealized world picture. Then there is spirituality which is the ancient science to make your own way through the life process. When we have realised that the things around us and the relationships are momentary - why to practice detachment and why not get engrossed into it? 

What is bad in utilitarian view that everything in this world has been put to satisfy our needs and desires. We, the human beings - the most intelligent, has the most authority over all of the world's resources or items. It's upto us to use them effectively with all of its properties being put to good use.

If the tree is revealing itself in terms of leaves and branches and trunk only, what's the purpose of getting to the essence. In fact, all we have to do is interact in its presence only that we are seeing or feeling. The idea is that - our senses are very shallow and trivial to supply us good datapoints.

The failures of science and widespread stress and anxiety and dissatisfaction are a proof of that. 

We have to go back to our ancient knowledge mentioned in *Vedas* and *Upnishads*.

Another definition of Maya is that something which restricts us from witnessing the complete truth or the ultimate Reality.
