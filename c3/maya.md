# Maya

The things that we cannot comprehend is called Maya. It is sometimes synonym with magic but is much deeper and has more profound meaning. 

It talks about our limited knowledge and understanding. It simply means illusion - what appears to be there is, but is not fully true. In the grandeur of the complexities of Universe, illusions are inevitable. Limited knowledge about the working of Universal phenomena - either objectively subjectively is perfectly fine. 

But the problem begins when me realise that our day-to-day life and the basis of our experiences are fleeting and not fully known.

Hence, we start saying that everything is Maya - something that we interact to but do not comprehend in its entirety. You must have heard of the blind men and the elephant story. Each one person perceives different organ of the elephant and creates a visual image of the animal. Each one has differing views about the animal as they could not comprehend it in ite entirty. The same is with the Humans and their worldview.

They interact, they learn and they mature - but the cosmos have different ways to surprise them or to blow them a setback. It is not a negative view or philosophy to account for Maya when we are adventuring towards knowing the unknown. There are limits to human knowledge and understanding and there are laws about uncertainties in the measurement of things. Every scientific observation is essentially sampling one of the possibilities out of a plethora of possible states the object of interest could be in. The whole universa has a role in deciding its possible states.

These are just that the science is accounting for the existence of Maya in our worldly observations. 

There is a quest in whole of our philosophies either from the west or from orient - about the nature of the things. It shows an inherent restlessness of human psych·∏çopy to remove the threads from the veil of Maya and hence know more and take more informed decision.

So Maya is at the core of all of human accomplishments, desires, feats and philosophies.

All of knowledge - physics, chemisty, maths, biology and logic and reasonings stem from philosophy which has roots in psycholgy - our upbringing and the inputs fed as memory. And this tree is standing in the garden of Maya.

Maya is not the negative aspect of the Reality (the whole truth). To put it simply, whenever you notice change - it is Maya, because it's not what it looked or felt earlier. 

When we witness a change in something - in its properties/attributes altogether, it should strike to us that what existed before the change was Maya or transitory or falsehood.
