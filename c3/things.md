# Nature of things

Different objects in the Universe exhibit different properties, as we perceive or observe them, and that is how we know them and distinguish among them. 

If we look at trees - they have varied number of branches and leaves and the forms and shapes of leaves too vary. Leaves show green colour, but we know they get yellow in autumn and then it becomes grey.

Things change over time - that's how the evolution works. Survival of the fittest attributes in the nature of things. If the change happens in a smaller period of time relative to our lifetime - we are certain of such changes happening ae part of the true nature of it. Also, if the change happens over centuries that's not part of our quest. We want to know things but we don't want to dwell on the superficial.

When we start to know a subject, we know in parts, categories, classifications. As the knowledge solidifies we realise that the categories are more of mixed up or dispersed, overlapping and that there is less structure and more of inter-mixing.

These are the two extremes about the existence and knowing them - structured completely and randomness. Bit of structure is there in all sorts of randomness. And it's this grey region where things, processes and knowing is always fluctuating. 

Knowing in structures degrade the thing in ite entirety - devoid of infinite possibilities of its states. Knowing in randomness doesn't actually add any value in our memory. It's just how things are. It is inactionable knowledge. 

However, these extremes are decided and created by our own cognition and comprehension only. What is structure for somebody, it's complete chaos for the another. Time also plays a role in moving from stucture to chaos.
