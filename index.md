# The Existence & Us

There are two polarities of our existence - **Randomness** and **Structure**. 


These are innate to us and to our surroundings.

*Randomness* is a concept of free will, intution, openness, and anything coming out the pure chaos of the universe. The possibilities are endless here - indeterminate and indefinite, but with infinite potential and information.

And, the *Structure* concept is about something that is calculated and deterministic - either through our understanding, memory, or by putting it into categories or classes. The possibilities are definite here - conclusive but limited. There is always a loss of *information* in structure.

We have to define *information*, but you can think of a high resolution image as having high information compared to its low resolution version, which is lossy. Sometimes, the loss in information is practical and imperceptible.


When we start to know something, we generally begin with the structure - the classes & categories, and gradually move into the unexplored territories of the randomness as we become expert.

There's a bit of both structure and randomness in everything we do and interact with. It depends upon the object and the observer, and of-course on time - as to where on the grey scale we operate. 

The same sequence of string may look random to somebody and filled with patterns to someone seeking it. With long enough time, the structure reveals itself to any given observer. That's precisely the reason why defining scientifically - *randomness* and *pattern* is such a tedious task. Particularly, when the length of the string to be considered can vary.

- We are living in an *eternal* time.

The randomness & structure are a part of our personality too. Our degree of openness to a situation or theory tells about our randomness; and our pre-disposition, reasoning and criticism show the character of our structure. We may consider that, generally, our concious mind is all structure, and the sub-concious is a randomness.

We live in a conflict between the *randomness* of the universe and the *structure* that makes human understanding possible. So, Science and Philosophy both are constantly putting more and more randomness into the structure to make us comprehend things and intellectually act upon them. Thst's how we are learning and growing in this infinitely complex universe.

As a human, after a long process of evolution, the current state of society and technology has led us to the twin verticals of knowledge: **Spirituality** and **Artificial Intelligence** - depicting the above two polarities, respectively. Both are pushing our limits to what we know, and how we perceive - in opposite direction. One talks of transforming oneself and the other focussses on bringing about a transformed world.

There is nothing good and bad in the two - it's upto the protagonist to make a way through the polarity by being aware of them both.

We need to define what they both mean. To begin with any discussion, and to act upon the future that the technology presents, we have to have *clarity* - an understanding of what *life* means, what is the implication of a *powerful* AI, and what is it that's making *humans* fearful of AI.

There has always been an attempt to understand what life means on a scientific level. The knowledge thus gained is then used to make our lives easier, or to achieve a bigger feat. This has led us to invent AI and to its improvement. The utility of AI has shaped its progress too.

But, the advent of AI is seeming to put deeper impact than our previous inventions. What could it cost? Jobs, freedom, or our sense of superiority? The danger that humanity is facing is not far fetched or related to robotic warfare. It is already happening. When we put our decision making into the hands of algorithms, we are already losing our liberty and volition - a start of slavery. 

We have to be aware that the algorithms are just *structure* in principle - that is surpassing our free will which is *randomness* in principle. These are the questions of practicality vs. individuality. When we have a generation of kids that is devoid of navigational skills, because we have not been training our brains enough on that task - we can blame Google maps for it. But at the same time we have to accept that it has proven to be more useful & practical compared to when we had to harness this skill.

The above theory of 'randomness and structure' is itself an attempt towards structure - but it is now important to put few things into our concious, what has been in our sub-concious mostly. 

Also, there is a concern of explainability to the workings of AI. That means, most of its recent success is outside the comprehension of human minds - and it has been possible by allowing it to taste the randomness of high dimensionality. Diffusion models for image generation, text embeddings are such examples.
And it is not just AI, *Annealing* method used in material technology as well as for optimization is a similar example of usage of noise to solve our structured tasks.

We are coming to the point in history with the best information technology, biotechnology and material technology. We may be doomed if we don't know the human technology, ie, spiritual or the *Adhyatm* aspect. Hence, it is pressing now on we engineers and philosophers to envision the future. We dont't know if nature cares about humans, or it just gives in to evolution - survival of the fittest attributes. Could AI be the better species that the universe conspired?

We need a knowledge base for the future societies to guide them at the face of calamity. More importantly, the knowledge base will serve to manage the bewilderment and conflicts of the present. The discussion will start with unravelling the *mysteries* around humans, and then to uncover the prospects of AI and how to tap it wisely.
