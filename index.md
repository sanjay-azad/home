# The Existence and Us


There are two polarities in our existence: randomness and structure.


These are innate to us and to our surroundings. Almost anything that we know or don't know can be put into these two categories.

*Randomness* is the concept of free will, intuition, openness, and anything coming out of the pure chaos of the universe. The possibilities are endless here, with infinite potential and information, but indeterminate and indefinite.

And the *Structure* concept is about something that is calculated and deterministic - either through our understanding, memory, or by putting it into categories or classes. The possibilities are definite here - conclusive but limited. There is always a loss of information in structure.

We have to define *information*, but you can think of a high-resolution image as having high information compared to its low-resolution version, which is lossy. Sometimes, the loss of information is practical and imperceptible.


When we start to know something, we generally begin with the structure - the classes and categories, and gradually move into the unexplored territories of randomness - where boundaries overlap and conflicting ideas co-exist as we become experts.

There's a bit of both structure and randomness in everything we do and interact with. It depends upon the object and the observer, and of course on time, as to where on the grey scale we operate.

The same sequence of string with 1s and 0s may look random to somebody and filled with pattern to someone seeking it. With enough time, the structure reveals itself to any given observer. That's precisely the reason why defining scientifically *randomness* and *pattern* is such a tedious task. Particularly when the length of the string to be considered can vary, it can either create the pattern or introduce randomness.

- We are living in an *eternal* time. The length of the string is ever-increasing.

Randomness and structure are part of our personalities too. Our degree of openness to a situation or idea tells about our randomness, and our pre-disposition, reasoning, and criticism show the character of our structure. We may consider that, generally, our conscious and sub-conscious minds operate in both domains, giving rise to free will and our deterministic behaviours.

We live in a conflict between the *randomness* of the universe or existence and the *structure* that makes human understanding possible. So, science and philosophy are both constantly putting more and more randomness into the structure to make us comprehend things and intellectually act upon them. That's how we are learning and growing in this infinitely complex universe.

As humans, after a long process of evolution, the current state of society and technology has led us to the twin verticals of knowledge: **Spirituality** and **Artificial Intelligence** - depicting the above two polarities, respectively. Both are pushing our limits to what we know and how we perceive - in opposite direction. One talks of transforming oneself, and the other focuses on bringing about a transformed world.

There is nothing good or bad in the two; as we have seen, is the case with randomness and structure. We cannot comprehend the spiritual dimensions, hence it is randomness for us, and we can create an AI model on anything, so it is structure for us. At a time when AI is making leaps of progress, it becomes necessary to talk about what our own intelligence means.

To begin with any discussion and to act upon the future that the technology presents, we have to have *clarity* - an understanding of what *life* means, what the implication of a *powerful* AI is, and what it is that's making *humans* fearful of AI.

There has always been an attempt to understand 'life' on a scientific level. The knowledge thus gained is then used to make our lives easier or to achieve a bigger feat. This has led us to invent AI and improve it. The utility of AI has shaped its progress too.


But the advent of AI seems to have a deeper impact than our previous inventions. What could it cost? Jobs, freedom, or our sense of superiority? The danger that humanity is facing is not far-fetched or related to robotic warfare. The danger is imminent. When we put our decision-making into the hands of algorithms, we are already losing our liberty and volition - a start of slavery.


We have to be aware that the computer algorithms are essentially *structure* in principle, and that is surpassing our decision making, which is *randomness* in principle. The level of complexity that a computer and its artificial memory can handle obviously makes computers efficient against humans. But there is a concern that the push for AI technologies has resulted in improved algorithms that are more useful than human cognition.

These are the questions of practicality vs. individuality. When we have a generation of kids that is devoid of navigational skills because we have not been training our brains enough on that task, we can blame Google Maps for it. But at the same time, we have to accept that it has proven to be more useful and practical compared to when we had to harness that skill.


The above theory of 'randomness and structure' is itself an attempt towards *structure*, but it is now important to put a few things into our conscious, what has been in our subconscious mostly, and the reason is AI - and the fears & revelations originating out of it.


We are coming to a point in history with the best information technology, biotechnology, and material technology. We may be doomed if we don't know the human technology, i.e., the spiritual or *Adhyatm* aspect. Hence, it is pressing now for engineers and philosophers to envision the future. We don't know if nature cares about humans at all or if it just gives in to the evolution and survival of the fittest attributes. Could AI be the better species that the universe conspired to create?

We need a knowledge base for future societies to guide them in the face of calamity. More importantly, the knowledge base will serve to manage the bewilderment and conflicts of the present. The discussion will start with unravelling the *mysteries* around humans and then uncovering the prospects of AI and how to tap it wisely.
