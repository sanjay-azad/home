# Humans & the AI

There are two verticals. **Humanism** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

We have to define what both means. To begine with any discussion, and to act upon the future that technology presents - we have to have *clarity*, a clear cut understanding of what *life* means, what is making the AI *powerful*, and what is it making *humans* fearful of AI.

The title is a thoughtful one: we live in a constant tussle between *randomness* of the universe and the *structure* that makes human understanding possible. Science is constantly putting more and more randomness into the structure.

There has always been an attempt to understand what life means on a scientific level. The knowledge thus gathered is being used to make our lives easier, or by achieving a bigger feat. Those who feel dazzled by the progress of AI, maybe should look deeper into the learning process of humans. What we boast of 'human intution' might well be a product of past conditionings and pattern recognition. If humans remain limited in *data* and *intelligence* in their way of knowing - maybe AI is going to surpass it in a decade or two from now.

Hence, it is pressing now on we engineers and philosophers to envision the future and help governments formulate the policies before it is driven by the invisible hands of the capitalists and investors.

We need a knowledge base for the future societies to guide them at the face of calamity. More importantly, the knowledge base will serve to manage the bewilderment and conflicts of the present. The discussion will start with unravelling the *mysteries* around humans, and then to uncover the prospects of AI and how to tap it wisely.
