# AI and the Spirituality

There are two verticals. Artificial Intelligence and Humanism.

We have to define what both means. To begine with any discussion, and to act upon the future that technology presents - we have to have clarity, a clear cut understanding of what life means, what is it that makes AI powerful, and what is the thing that's making humans fearful of AI.

There is a barrage of materials on the internet, primarily because it is the hot topic now. We need a knowledge base for the future societies to guide them at the face of calamity. More importantly, the knowledge base will serve to manage the bewilderment and conflicts of the present.

There has always been an attempt to understand what life means on a scientific level. The knowledge thus gathered is being used to create our lives easier by either automating the task or achieving a bigger feat.
