# Introduction

Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term. It includes different *scientific* ways through which we obtain an intelligent system, outside the natural *life* systems.
Here, we try to put into machines some sort of reasoning, decision-making, and cognition.

There is intelligence in both of them - life and science. It's just that science is more structured, definite, and limited.

As soon as there is subjectivity in knowledge, it goes outside of science, e.g., spirituality, which is based on personal experience, and there is no way to replicate the exact same result on two different people (at least for now). But, we have to understand that the subjectivity comes because of our inability to model the totality or to put the object in a definite, structured and comprehensible way. 


So, the scope of science is ever-increasing as we encapsulate and systematise more and more of our life knowledge and make it objective (worthy of being imparted with zero variability). Thus, we accept that science is always limited - purposefully, as it does not accept any subjectivity. Also, it need not be error-free. The catch here is that, while relying on the objectivity of science, we are relying on our sense organs, which are not foolproof.

There are a few measures of intelligence: understanding patterns, decision-making, language understanding, willpower, and emotions. Emotions and belief-framing are the least understood aspects of intelligence, as per science, as there is a lot of variability.

Artificially intelligent agents are those scientific systems that cross certain thresholds at the above-mentioned measures of intelligence (in human perception).
Machine learning and deep learning (neural networks) are some of the ways to have an AI agent. Others include robotics, control systems, game engines, material technology, etc.

To understand AI, it is important to know few terms:

**Life:** We all know that living beings on Earth are endowed with some intelligence to undergo their life processes and activities. They take actions based on their bodily needs, and their body manufactures hormones and processes electrical impulses. Thus, they ensure the survival of their species through evolution. The intelligence that drives this whole process is called life. We feel and we believe, and that shapes how we behave towards external triggers. Some beliefs are inherent, and some we formulate as we live. Our intelligence is responsible for our constant learning. We share those learnings through certain levels of communication and cooperation, which is itself a measure of intelligence. Some of the aspects of life have already been modelled by science as evident from the organ transplants - which are successfully functioning.


**Science:** Knowledge - that is systematic, structured, and objective comes under the category of science. All sorts of knowledge, true or untrue - if it has been derived by following a systematic procedure and if it is objective in nature, i.e., can be imparted through teaching with zero variability, then this knowledge is scientific. It involves experimentation, covering - data gathering, processing, and inferencing. There is a lot of doubt around the utility and contribution of science, mostly because its definition is not clear to the public and partly because it has been used by humans to exploit resources. The objective of science is to create human understandable models around all of the natural phenomena to enable us to see the totality.


**World** The world around us is filled with uncertainties. Some of the aspects - we have been able to model through physics, chemistry and biology. Some, we are still researching like psychology and neuroscience. Sometimes the world seems chaotic, sometimes it becomes predictable. When we are able to predict - that means we know in and out of the system. When we do organ transplant, we know in and out of the system. When we do agriculture, we know the process of germination and its required conditions.

**AI** There must exist some way to mimic the equation that govern different phenomena. That is what AI assumes to capture. We dont know the equation, but our AI models try to fit as close as possible in mathematical sense to capture the working of the world - using just input and output data. Started with imitating the pattern recognition, it has graduated to do the cognitive decision making, and language understanding. It depends upon two things - how well it will perform: the quality of data associated with the phenomena and the learning method to estimate the system equation. Data & Intelligence.


There is a concern about the explainability of the workings of AI. That means most of its recent success is outside the comprehension of human minds, and it has been made possible by allowing it to taste the randomness of high dimensionality. Diffusion models for image generation and text embeddings for language modeling are such examples.
And it is not just AI; the annealing method used in material technology as well as for optimisation is a similar example of the usage of noise to solve our structured tasks.
