# Digital World

Why do we need a digital world? Or to ask differently, what were the necessities that drove mankind to go digital and build a world around it?
Stepping into the digital was one thing and residing into it is another.

From the early days of our inventions and explorations, we have been working to make our lives better. What does 'better' involve? - having freedom to choose from, and having security and control. Control of outside world as well as of our internal demands. We built ethics and science.

The inventions have been mostly assisted by the external world together with our own curiosity and mind. We realised the importance of tools - like stones, knives, wheels to achieve our tasks. Fire was another such tool. Mathematics became one such tool to account for the data that we see in everyday life. It helped in an objective measure of wealth and transactions.

Together - physics and maths trie to capture the world and its phenomena. Science, assisted by maths became a tool to model the workings of the nature. 

The power to compute started to be realised as a necessity when the size of the data we were dealing with got severely complex. That requirement gave rise to calculators and computers. Progress in chips and semiconductors facilitated the output.

The demand for coders and programmers manifolded as the algorithms began to be increasingly discovered through the research in computing and processing. Challenges triggered new responses and improved algorithms and methods for information processing, and hence we see the arrival of the *information age*.

This is marked by the inter connected networks of computers sharing information. The onset of internet resulted in a blow up of digitally generated data and the processing capabilities in an exponential way.

The data thus generated promptem trend analysis and predictive analysis. The mathematics was ripe to enable methods of regression and classification. The search algorithms were greatly improved to look for the needed information in a haystack of data.

Long before all this, big breakthrough happened after WWII when Claude Shannon published his paper on information and its quantization named - *A mathematical theory of communication.*
This simple looking title was a ground breaking one as it heralded a transformation in our understanding of information.


### Information overload
It has become a big problem of today's world. We are bombarded with all kinds of information in the digital age - good or bad ones, suitable or unsuitable. Most of the information turns out to be mis-information, or something which is false but presented as truth.

Truth is very open word with diverse interpretation, but when we talk about misinformation - it is false in objective sense.

Knowledge and information are different. We are running behind information - maybe because of the success of media and news reporting. As humans, we always crave to know more, and the fuel that quench the thirst has been the data and information. 

*Data is gold* - a very popular saying, because of the emergence of AI in past few decades. But it was never gold. It keeps on changing and puts us to stress.
